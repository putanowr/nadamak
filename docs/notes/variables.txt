There are two levels of variables description :

1. Variables hold on Problem level.
2. Variables hold on FemModel level.

Variables on Problem level include all kind of variables or better call 
it parameters: both known and unknown. Unknown variables include 
displacement field, stresse. Known variables include for instance gravity

Variable on FemModel level is the subset of Problem variables that are
state variables to be calculated.
