## Welcome to Nadamak

**This project have just started, thus many things are not setup yet.**

# What is Nadamak

Nadamak is a project to create a set of tools helping with research on computational mechanics.
Nadamak is implemented in Matlab with some some infrastructure support in Python.

# Demos

While documentation is being prepared one can look at [demo pages](https://putanowr.github.io/projects/nadamak/demos/html/list_of_demos.html). 

# Documentation 

Documentation is absolutely essential part of Nadamak, however making it is
huge effort. Despite the fact that Nadamak guide barely scratches the surface
of the subject you can look at [HTML version of
it](https://putanowr.github.io/projects/nadamak/guide/en/html/index.html).
